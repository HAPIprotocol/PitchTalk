In order to see how much money you have donated or invested in a project, you need to:

- be authorized on the platform from the wallet from which you made a donation or investment;

- find (as shown earlier) the project you need;

- under the block with a video of any of the pitches, find a block of donations and investments;

- select the "User" mode on the block switch.

After that, you will be able to see the amount of your donation or investment, as well as the currency in which the transaction was carried out.

Also in the viewer's personal account you can see the total amount of your donations and investments.
