Vesting is the distribution of project tokens according to a given schedule for a given period of time.

This means that the entire amount of tokens available to the investor will be divided into parts (equal or not equal) and will be unlocked for claiming within several specified periods.

Important: project tokens will not be automatically sent to investors' wallets. In order to withdraw his tokens, the investor must independently go to the project page and claim the tokens due to him.
