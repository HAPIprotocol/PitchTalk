An investment is a return financing of a project by viewers or investors. In exchange for the collected funds, the project undertakes to issue its tokens in the future and distribute them among the persons who invested in it.

Information about tokens and the timing of their distribution will appear on the project page in the Vesting section after the project releases tokens.
