In order for you to be able to donate funds to the project, it is necessary that:

- the project has published its second pitch (Update);

- you are authorized on the platform with your wallet;

- you have funds on your wallet in the currency that the project accepts

You can directly send a donation by going to the project page (by opening any pitch of this project). The button for accepting donations is located under the pitch video screen. Clicking it will open your NEAR Wallet interface, where you can enter the desired donation amount and sign the transaction.

If the transaction was successful, you will see a notification in the upper right corner of the page.
